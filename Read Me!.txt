Please let me know if there are any issues!

Don't forget to extract the UnEssay project folder if there are issues:
Right-Click(on folder) -> extract all


//////////////////


In order to access the main application, you have to open the folders
in this order:

UnEssay project -> dist -> BeowulfStory -> BeowulfStory.exe

Please note that if a command prompt window opens, it is COMPLETELY NORMAL.
It is necessary to open the game, but I should have it disabled.

The build folder is necessary for the program to run


////////////////



I have attached the following files for this project:



-BeowulfStory.exe -- my main project deliverable. (dist -> BeowulfStory -> BeowulfStory.exe)
##Please note that if a command prompt window opens, it is COMPLETELY NORMAL.
It is necessary to open the game, but I should have it disabled.##


-BeowulfStory.txt -- my source code in a .txt format. You should
be able to read this on your computer


-BeowulfStory.py -- DO NOT open this, this is my source code that
I created before it was translated. If you have a python interpreter,
you can run this using that, but it is unnecessary.


-Unessay reflection - BeowulfStory.docx -- This is my reflection essay for
this project.


///////////////////


The main 2 files you should look at are:

BeowulfStory.exe

and 

UnEssay reflection - BeowulfStory.docx

-- I hope you enjoy!--
